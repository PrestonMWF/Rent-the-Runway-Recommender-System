# Rent-The-Runway Customer Analysis & Recommender SystemÂ¶

For this project, I've developed a suite of recommender system options in Python using Rent-the-Runway data. The company offers a large selection of women's clothing items and accessories that can be rented using the service. The collection has over 17,000 items for customers to choose from, which makes finding the right item a top business priority. As such, developing recommendation system choices for the company is a major business problem. In fact, when looking around the website for the first time, a recommendation system pops up and after answering a few questions (to address the cold-start problem), I received a page of suggestions. This validates the set and project as realistically in line with what the company is doing.

The five recommender methods I worked on include:
- Popularity
- Matrix Factorization (Collaborative Filtering)
- User K-means (Collaborative Filtering)
- TF-IDF Cosine Matrix (Content-Based Filtering)
- Item TF-IDF & Attribute K-NN (Content-Based Filtering)
